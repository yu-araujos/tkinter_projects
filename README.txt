# Welcome to My Portfolio of Tkinter Projects

Hello, welcome to my portfolio of projects using Tkinter. This project was created for me to practice my basic Python concepts, and I used the graphical user interface to help me achieve results with visual elements.

There are two available projects:

1. **A simple calculator** - It does basic calculations, so please don't judge it too harshly haha.
2. **Snake game** - The goal is to eat as many fruits as you can. This one is more elaborate, so I hope you enjoy it! :)

Just a reminder: these projects are not focused on design, but rather on the programming concepts applied.

See you soon with a brief update, and thank you! :)
